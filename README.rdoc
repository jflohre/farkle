== Welcome to jflohre's Farkle

This was built so people can play the dice game farkle

To start playing please pull down the game and start a server with it.
Then go to your localhost, or server location and start playing!

You can play 2 players at a time 

Once a player's score is above 10,000 then it goes into the final round and the other player gets a chance to pass him!

The game is based on the honor system so it is up to the player to keep track of turns and farkling.
